        <h1>DARK MODE</h1>
        <p style="text-align:left";>
            Dark mode is a display setting for user interfaces, such as a smartphone or laptop.<br>
            <br>
            It means that, instead of the default dark text showing up against a light screen (known as ‘light mode’), a light colour text (white or grey) is presented against a dark or black screen.<br>
            <br>
            Light mode, however, is the default setting for most phones and apps.<br>
            <br>
            Dark mode can also be known as:<br>
            -black mode<br>
            -dark theme<br>
            -night mode<br>
            -light-on-dark<br>
            <br>
            The idea behind dark mode is that it reduces the light emitted by device screens while maintaining the minimum colour contrast ratios required for readability.<br>
            <br>
            Both iPhones and Android handsets offer system-wide dark modes. However, you will still need to set up dark mode on some individual apps.<br>
            <br>
            Some PC operating systems offer dark mode too, enabling you to set it up on your desktop or laptop.

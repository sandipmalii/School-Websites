            Dark mode is a display setting for user interfaces, such as a smartphone or laptop.<br>
            It means that, instead of the default dark text showing up against a light screen (known as ‘light mode’), a light colour text (white or grey) is presented against a dark or black screen.<br>
            Light mode, however, is the default setting for most phones and apps.

            <i>Dark mode can also be known as:</i><br>
            -<u>black mode</u><br>
            -<em>dark theme</em><br>
            -night mode<sup>2</sup><br>
            -light-on-dark<br>
            The idea behind dark mode is that it reduces the light emitted by device screens while maintaining the minimum colour contrast ratios required for readability.<br>
            <strike>Both iPhones and Android handsets offer system-wide dark modes.</strike> However, you will still need to set up dark mode on some individual apps.<br>
            Some PC operating systems offer dark mode too, enabling you to set it up on your desktop or laptop.
